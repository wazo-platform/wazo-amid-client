# wazo-amid-client

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.wazo.community/buildStatus/icon?job=wazo-amid-client)](https://jenkins.wazo.community/job/wazo-amid-client)

A python library to connect to wazo-amid.

Usage:

```python
from wazo_amid_client import Client

c = Client('localhost', port=9491, version='1.0', timeout=3, token='valid-token')

results = c.action('QueueSummary')
results = c.action('DBGet', {'Family': 'test', 'Key': 'variable'})
results = c.command('core show channels')
results = c.status()
```


## How to implement a new command

Someone trying to implement a new command to the client would have to implement a new class,
sub-classing the RESTCommand (available in wazo-lib-rest-client). The new class must be in the
setup.py in the entry points under wazo_amid_client.commands. The name of the entry point is used as
the handle on the client. For example, if your new entry point entry looks like this:

```python
entry_points={
    'wazo_amid_client.commands': [
        'foo = package.to.foo:FooCommand'
    ]
}
```

then your command will be accessible from the client like this:

```python
c = Client(...)

c.foo.bar()  # bar is a method of the FooCommand class
```
